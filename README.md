# ProjectManagement
Project Management Application
This application is a comprehensive solution for managing projects, specifically designed for three main user categories:

Project Managers: Responsible for creating projects, assigning tasks, tracking progress, and managing resources.
Team Members: Responsible for updating task statuses, logging hours, and maintaining communication.
Stakeholders: Although they might not interact directly with the tool, stakeholders have access to reports and overviews of the project status.
The application is designed with a robust set of features:

User Registration and Authentication: Different access levels for administrators, project managers, and team members.
Project Creation and Management: Enables project managers to create, parameterize, and close projects.
Task Management: Allows task creation, assignment, and tracking through their lifecycle.
Time Tracking: Team members can log hours spent on tasks.
Collaboration Tools: Includes comments on tasks, file attachments, and chat features.
Notifications: Users receive updates about task assignments and changes in task status.
Reporting and Analytics: Provides overviews of project progress, budget usage, task status, etc., in the form of dashboards and reports.
The application is developed using Angular for front-end and a chosen technology for backend (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java). The backend is connected to a database to store information about users, projects, and tasks. The application follows RESTful best practices and implements various security measures. The entire system is tested on different browsers and screen sizes to ensure compatibility.

The development process includes the design phase, frontend and backend development, integration and testing, and finally, deployment to a suitable hosting platform.

This application embodies a clean and practical design for a seamless user experience, making project management easier, efficient, and effective.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
